# Basic-Stock-Screener
---
This is an attempt at the development of a program that is able to make calls to an API.
The API that is being used is the https://www.alphavantage.co.
It was recommended to me by google searches and youtube videos. The requirement to make requests is that you register for an API key.

## Functionality
The program is able to make requests for market data regarding either
  * Intraday 
  * Daily
  * Weekly
  * Monthly
  * Endpoint data
It is further able to search for stock, forex and crypto currency market data. 

## What I learned
* Parsing JSON data
* Making HTTP requests, POST and GET requests
* How URLs are structured and how parameters are added to them (parameters are added after ?)
* Basic understanding of how Hashmaps work
